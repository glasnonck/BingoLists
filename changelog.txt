KotOR Bingo Changelog v6.0

Overall Features of v6.0 (a.k.a. TL;DR):
- All 25 groups have 9 tasks each for 225 total tasks
- Added 41 tasks and removed 22 tasks since v5.0
- 81 returning tasks changed category
- 29 returning tasks were tweaked
- Removed several near-duplicate tasks to encourage more variety in rows
- The hardest tasks have been fully revamped to remove the truly awful ones and add some additional Star Forge and Lehon tasks
- Introduced tiered tasks with multiple versions; for instance, 8 Different Lightsaber Power Crystals, 13 Different Lightsaber Power Crystals, and 15 Different Lightsaber Power Crystals
- GenoHaradan tasks have been pared down and grouped together for fewer rows that require them
- Tasks that only required a certain level have been entirely removed; the Yuthura XP glitch made them both difficult to balance and boring
